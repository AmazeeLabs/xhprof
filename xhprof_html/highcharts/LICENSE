The Highcharts library is a commercial product available free for non-commercial use.

A license has been purchased for the XHProf GUI application, as such it is free to use
within this application regardless of the nature of your site (commercial or otherwise).

You do _not_ need to purchase another Highcharts license to use XHProf. Though, if you wish
to use the charting library elsewhere on your site, you're on your own.
